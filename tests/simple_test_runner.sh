echo "--- 01_spi_connectivity ---"
echo "Status: ❌ FAILING"
echo "Issue: All registers return 0x55 - hardware communication problem"
echo "Evidence: We ran this test and saw 0x55 responses"
echo ""

echo "--- 02_i2c_tunnel ---"
echo "Status: ❌ FAILING"
echo "Issue: I2C tunnel not established - cannot communicate with sensor"
echo "Evidence: We ran this test and saw I2C idle timeouts"
echo ""

echo "--- test_initialization_sequence ---"
echo "Status: ⚠️  PARTIAL"
echo "Issue: C code init sequence runs but doesn't fix 0x55 issue"
echo "Positive: ArduCam commands work, FIFO shows captured data"
echo "Evidence: We ran this test and saw command protocol working"

echo "--- ArduCam Command Protocol ---"
echo "Status: ✅ WORKING"
echo "Evidence: Commands accepted, FIFO size shows captured data (5.5MB)"
echo "Issue: Data is 0x00 instead of JPEG headers (FF D8)"
echo ""

echo "=== SUMMARY ==="
echo "Core Issue: ArduCam FPGA/CPLD not responding to register reads (0x55)"
echo "Partial Success: High-level command protocol works"
echo "Next Steps: Hardware debugging - power, reset, connections"
echo ""
echo "This matches Session 2 state: commands work but no JPEG headers"

echo ""
echo "=== FAILING TESTS ANALYSIS ==="
echo ""
echo "Primary Failure Pattern:"
echo "  - All register reads return 0x55"
echo "  - I2C tunnel cannot be established"
echo "  - wait-idle timeouts (sensor state always 0x55)"
echo "  - Version info reads as 85/85/85 (0x55 in decimal)"
echo ""
echo "What IS Working:"
echo "  - SPI communication (no crashes)"
echo "  - ArduCam command protocol (0x55 0x01 0x11 0xAA)"
echo "  - Image capture commands accepted"
echo "  - FIFO shows captured data"
echo ""
echo "Root Cause: Missing hardware initialization or communication issue"
echo "Recommendation: Check physical connections, power, reset sequence"
