report_test "02_i2c_tunnel" "❌ FAILING" "I2C tunnel initialization" "Cannot establish I2C tunnel - wait-idle timeouts"

report_test "02_init_simple" "⚠️  PARTIAL" "Camera initialization" "Init runs but doesn't fix register communication"

report_test "03_command_protocol" "✅ WORKING" "ArduCam command protocol" "High-level commands accepted (0x55 0x01 0x11 0xAA)"

report_test "04_capture_basic" "⚠️  PARTIAL" "Basic image capture" "Capture commands work, FIFO shows data"

report_test "05_format_jpeg" "❌ FAILING" "JPEG format verification" "FIFO data is 0x00, no JPEG headers (FF D8)"

report_test "06_c_style_capture" "❌ FAILING" "C-style register capture" "Depends on register reads which return 0x55"

report_test "06_integration_full" "❌ FAILING" "Full integration test" "Multiple format issues due to register communication"

echo "2. Investigate why register reads fail while commands work"
